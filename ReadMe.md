# Data Confidentiality Enhancer

This project introduces an innovative security model that combines the robustness of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cryptography with the subtlety of Least Significant Bit (LSB) Image Steganography, aiming to enhance data confidentiality beyond conventional methods.
The integration of LSB Image Steganography and AES Cryptography leverages the strengths of both techniques: the AES algorithm ensures the encrypted data's resilience against cryptographic attacks, while LSB Steganography conceals the very existence of the encrypted data within images, making it less susceptible to interception or scrutiny. This dual-layered approach significantly complicates unauthorized access to the data, providing an enhanced level of security.
